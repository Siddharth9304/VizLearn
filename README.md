🔧 Installation

To set up VizLearn locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/viz-learn.git

Navigate to the project folder:

cd viz-learn

Install dependencies:

npm install

Run the development server:

npm start

Open http://localhost:3000/ in your browser to access the application.



🎯 Usage

Select a Data Structure (Stack, Queue, Linked List) or Algorithm (Infix to Postfix, Linear Search) from the menu.

Click on the Start Visualization button.

Observe the step-by-step execution of the algorithm.

Experiment with different inputs to see how the algorithm adapts.



🚀 Future Enhancements

We have exciting plans to expand VizLearn further! Here’s what’s coming next:

🔜 Graph Algorithms - BFS and DFS Traversal Visualizations.

🔜 Sorting Algorithms - Step-by-step animations for Sorting techniques.

🔜 More Data Structures - Including Trees and Heaps.

🔜 Enhanced User Interactions - More control over animations and inputs.

🔜 Algorithm Race Mode - Compare different algorithms side by side to analyze their efficiency.
